# CF Post Formats

This is my fork of [CF Post Formats](https://github.com/crowdfavorite/wp-post-formats), a WordPress plugin that improves on the default post format UI.

* [Alex King's post about this project](http://alexking.org/blog/2011/10/25/wordpress-post-formats-admin-ui).
* [Original ticket on the WordPress trac](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19570).
* [Post formats UI exist WordPress 3.6 core](http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/05/29/post-formats-ui-is-exiting-core-will-live-as-a-plugin/).
* Merged with version 1.3.1 of the original plugin.
* Compatible with WordPress 3.8.1.

Modifications to the original plugin in this fork:

* Title and date fields added to the quotation post format UI to [allow compliance with the HTML5 specification](http://synapticism.com/working-with-wordpress-post-formats-and-quotations/).
* Autotitle feature now based on 10 words rather than 50 characters.
* Autotitle feature currently requires saving a draft before the slug is created.
